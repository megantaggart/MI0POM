# HexBeam Improvements

This project documents enhancements and modifications to my homemade HexBeam antenna system. The original HexBeam covers multiband operation on HF frequencies with a lightweight directional design.

## Current System

The existing HexBeam antenna features:
- **Bands**: 20m / 17m / 15m / 12m / 10m / 6m
- **Type**: Lightweight directional beam antenna
- **Rotation**: Yaesu rotator with custom Arduino controller
- **Construction**: Full homemade build including controller software

## Improvement Goals

This project focuses on:
- Performance optimization across all bands
- Controller software enhancements
- Mechanical stability improvements
- Enhanced band coverage options

More details coming soon as the project develops...

## Related Equipment

- **Transceiver**: Flex Radio 6400
- **Tuner**: Flex Tuner Genius
- **Antenna Tuner**: MFJ Antenna Tuner (backup)
- **Rotator**: Yaesu rotator with Arduino control
