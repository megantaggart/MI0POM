# HexBeam Improvements

This project documents enhancements and modifications to my homemade HexBeam antenna system. The original HexBeam covers multiband operation on HF frequencies with a lightweight directional design.

## Current System

The existing HexBeam antenna features:
- **Bands**: 20m / 17m / 15m / 12m / 10m / 6m
- **Type**: Lightweight directional beam antenna
- **Rotation**: Yaesu rotator with custom Arduino controller
- **Construction**: Full homemade build including controller software

## Improvements

* use of fibre glass poles and mastraint cord to make very strong lightweight antenna
